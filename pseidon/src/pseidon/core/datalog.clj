  Wall files are short lived mostly in memory files that are used to guard against corrupt or lost clojure.data.Diff
  Buffers are not forced so some information might be lost, but it does give some layer of protection.
  Ideally a WALFile is created and deleted shortly after creation when the intended file of writing has been committed.

  (wal-write w (byte-array (map #(byte %) (range 10))) )
